JavaSE is a repo which is holy grail to hardcore Java programmers, it containes DS implementations from scratch, Algorithms , Collection Framework's classes & Interfaes examples (others too like HashMap), Java SE concepts and some Leetcode 
All with professional coding conventions, test case reliability, formatting and mind blowing logic.
